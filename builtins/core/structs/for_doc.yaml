    `for`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    A more familiar iteration loop to existing developers
  Description: |-
    This `for` loop is fills a small niche where `foreach` or `formap` are
    inappropiate in your script. It's generally not recommended to use `for`
    because it performs slower and doesn't adhere to Murex's design
    philosophy. However it does offer additional flexibility around recursion.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    for ( variable; conditional; incrementation ) { code-block } -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » for ( i=1; i<6; i++ ) { echo $i }
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    ```

    ### Syntax

    `for` is a little naughty in terms of breaking Murex's style guidelines due
    to the first parameter being entered as one string treated as 3 separate code
    blocks. The syntax is like this for two reasons:
      
    1. readability (having multiple `{ blocks }` would make scripts unsightly
    2. familiarity (for those using to `for` loops in other languages

    The first parameter is: `( i=1; i<6; i++ )`, but it is then converted into the
    following code:

    1. `let i=0` - declare the loop iteration variable
    2. `= i<0` - if the condition is true then proceed to run the code in
    the second parameter - `{ echo $i }`
    3. `let i++` - increment the loop iteration variable

    The second parameter is the code to execute upon each iteration

    ### Better `for` loops

    Because each iteration of a `for` loop reruns the 2nd 2 parts in the first
    parameter (the conditional and incrementation), `for` is very slow. Plus the
    weird, non-idiomatic, way of writing the 3 parts, it's fair to say `for` is
    not the recommended method of iteration and in fact there are better functions
    to achieve the same thing...most of the time at least.

    For example:

    ```
    a [1..5] -> foreach i { echo $i }
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    ```

    The different in performance can be measured. eg:

    ```
    » time { a [1..9999] -> foreach i { out <null> $i } }
    0.097643108

    » time { for ( i=1; i<10000; i=i+1 ) { out <null> $i } }
    0.663812496
    ```

    You can also do step ranges with `foreach`:

    ```
    » time { for ( i=10; i<10001; i=i+2 ) { out <null> $i } }
    0.346254973

    » time { a [1..999][0,2,4,6,8],10000 -> foreach i { out <null> $i } }
    0.053924326
    ```

    ...though granted the latter is a little less readable.

    The big catch with using `a` piped into `foreach` is that values are passed
    as strings rather than numbers.
