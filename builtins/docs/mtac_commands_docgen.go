	Definition["mtac"] = "# `mtac`\n\n> Reverse the order of an array\n\n## Description\n\n`mtac` takes input from STDIN and reverses the order of it.\n\nIt's name is derived from a program called `tac` - a tool that functions\nlike `cat` but returns the contents in the reverse order. The difference\nwith the `mtac` builtin is that it is data-type aware. So it doesn't just\nfunction as a replacement for `tac` but it also works on JSON arrays,\ns-expressions, and any other data-type supporting arrays compiled into\nMurex.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n<stdin> -> mtac -> <stdout>\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n» ja [Monday..Friday] -> mtac\n[\n    \"Friday\",\n    \"Thursday\",\n    \"Wednesday\",\n    \"Tuesday\",\n    \"Monday\"\n]\n\n# Normal output (without mtac)\n» ja [Monday..Friday]\n[\n    \"Monday\",\n    \"Tuesday\",\n    \"Wednesday\",\n    \"Thursday\",\n    \"Friday\"\n]\n```\n\n## Detail\n\nPlease bare in mind that while Murex is optimised with concurrency and\nstreaming in mind, it's impossible to reverse an incomplete array. Thus all\nall of STDIN must have been read and that file closed before `mtac` can\noutput.\n\nIn practical terms you shouldn't notice any difference except for when\nSTDIN is a long running process or non-standard stream (eg network pipe).\n\n## Synonyms\n\n* `mtac`\n* `list.reverse`\n\n\n## See Also\n\n* [`2darray` ](../commands/2darray.md):\n  Create a 2D JSON array from multiple input sources\n* [`a` (mkarray)](../commands/a.md):\n  A sophisticated yet simple way to build an array or list\n* [`append`](../commands/append.md):\n  Add data to the end of an array\n* [`count`](../commands/count.md):\n  Count items in a map, list or array\n* [`ja` (mkarray)](../commands/ja.md):\n  A sophisticated yet simply way to build a JSON array\n* [`jsplit` ](../commands/jsplit.md):\n  Splits STDIN into a JSON array based on a regex parameter\n* [`map`](../commands/map.md):\n  Creates a map from two data sources\n* [`msort`](../commands/msort.md):\n  Sorts an array - data type agnostic\n* [`prefix`](../commands/prefix.md):\n  Prefix a string to every item in a list\n* [`prepend`](../commands/prepend.md):\n  Add data to the start of an array\n* [`pretty`](../commands/pretty.md):\n  Prettifies JSON to make it human readable\n* [`suffix`](../commands/suffix.md):\n  Prefix a string to every item in a list\n* [`ta` (mkarray)](../commands/ta.md):\n  A sophisticated yet simple way to build an array of a user defined data-type"
