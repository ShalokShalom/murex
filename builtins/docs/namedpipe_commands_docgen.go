Murex adds a another layer around this to enable support for passing\ndata types and builtins which are agnostic to the data serialization format\ntraversing the pipeline. While this does add overhead the advantage is this new\nwrapper can be used as a primitive for channelling any data from one point to\nanother.\n\nMurex named pipes are where these pipes are created in a global store,\ndecoupled from any executing functions, named and can then be used to pass\ndata along asynchronously.\n\nFor example\n\n```\npipe: example\n\nbg {\n    <example> -> match: Hello\n}\n\nout: \"foobar\"        -> <example>\nout: \"Hello, world!\" -> <example>\nout: \"foobar\"        -> <example>\n\n!pipe: example\n```\n\nThis returns `Hello, world!` because `out` is writing to the **example** named\npipe and `match` is also reading from it in the background (`bg`).\n\nNamed pipes can also be inlined into the command parameters with `<>` tags\n\n```\npipe: example\n\nbg {\n    <example> -> match: Hello\n}\n\nout: <example> \"foobar\"\nout: <example> \"Hello, world!\"\nout: <example> \"foobar\"\n\n!pipe: example\n```\n\n> Please note this is also how `test` works.\n\nMurex named pipes can also represent network sockets, files on a disk or any\nother read and/or write endpoint. Custom builtins can also be written in Golang\nto support different abstractions so your Murex code can work with those read\nor write endpoints transparently.\n\nTo see the different supported types run\n\n```\nruntime --pipes\n```\n\n### Namespaces and usage in modules and packages\n\nPipes created via `pipe` are created in the global namespace. This allows pipes\nto be used across different functions easily however it does pose a risk with\nname clashes where Murex named pipes are used heavily. Thus is it recommended\nthat pipes created in modules should be prefixed with the name of its package.\n\n## Synonyms\n\n* `(murex named pipe)`\n* `<>`\n* `read-named-pipe`\n\n\n## See Also\n\n* [`<stdin>`](../commands/stdin.md):\n  Read the STDIN belonging to the parent code block\n* [`a` (mkarray)](../commands/a.md):\n  A sophisticated yet simple way to build an array or list\n* [`bg`](../commands/bg.md):\n  Run processes in the background\n* [`ja` (mkarray)](../commands/ja.md):\n  A sophisticated yet simply way to build a JSON array\n* [`pipe`](../commands/pipe.md):\n  Manage Murex named pipes\n* [`runtime`](../commands/runtime.md):\n  Returns runtime information on the internal state of Murex"
