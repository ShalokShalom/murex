	Definition["bexists"] = "# `bexists`\n\n> Check which builtins exist\n\n## Description\n\n`bexists` takes an array of parameters and returns which commands have been\ncompiled into Murex. The 'b' in `bexists` stands for 'builtins'\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nbexists command... -> <stdout>\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```\nÂ» bexists: qr gzip runtime config\n{\n    \"Installed\": [\n        \"runtime\",\n        \"config\"\n    ],\n    \"Missing\": [\n        \"qr\",\n        \"gzip\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Detail\n\nThis builtin dates back to the start of Murex when all of the builtins were\nconsidered optional. This was intended to be a way for scripts to determine\nwhich builtins were compiled. Since then `runtime` has absorbed and centralized\na number of similar commands which have since been deprecated. The same fate\nmight also happen to `bexists` however it is in use by a few modules and for\nthat reason alone it has been spared from the axe.\n\n## See Also\n\n* [Modules and Packages](../user-guide/modules.md):\n  An introduction to Murex modules and packages\n* [`fexec` ](../commands/fexec.md):\n  Execute a command or function, bypassing the usual order of precedence.\n* [`runtime`](../commands/runtime.md):\n  Returns runtime information on the internal state of Murex\n\n<hr/>\n\nThis document was generated from [builtins/core/management/functions_doc.yaml](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/blob/master/builtins/core/management/functions_doc.yaml)."
