    Special variables reserved by Murex
  Description: |-
    In Murex, there are four different classes of variables:
    1. Local variables (scope limited)
    2. Global variables (available to every function within Murex but not shared
        with processes outside of the Murex's runtime)
    3. Environmental variables (available to every function and process -- internal
        and external to Murex)
    4. Reserved variables

    Reserved variables are data that are available to any code running within
    Murex and exposed as a variable.

    Because reserved variables are dynamic properties of the runtime environment,
    they can only be queried and not set:
    ```
    Â» set SELF="foobar"
    Error in `set` (0,1): cannot set a reserved variable: SELF
    ```
