# What's new in murex v4.2 - Change Log

Murex usage has raised considerably in recent weeks. This release addresses a number of feature requests and bugs raised

### Breaking Changes

none

### Features

* new flag in `foreach`: `--step <int>. This allows the `foreach` to jump indexes at a time. When used, all the lines jumped are merged into a JSON array and that is passed to the `foreach` nested code block

* new alias `builtin` => `fexec builtin`. This was added to bring more familiarity to those coming from Bash et al ([#608](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/608))

* on Darwin, Homebrew defaults are imported, just like you'd expect them to be from any other shell

* aa few new hotkeys ([#611](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/611)) ([#613](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/613)):

  1. `ctrl`+`a`: jump to beginning of line

  2. `ctrl`+`e`: jump to end of line

  3. `alt`+`f`: jump forwards a word at a time

  4. `alt`+`b`: jump backwards a word at a time

  5. `ctrl`+`k`: clear line after cursor position

  6. `ctrl`+`l`: clear entire screen

* `open`` builtin should fallback to system default if type unknown ([#620](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/620)) 

* **auto-cd** option added to `config`: `config: set shell auto-cd true`. This allows you to traverse directories without having to prefix `cd`. By default it is disabled.

### Bug Fixes:

* brace encapsulated variables, eg `$(foobar)`, now autocomplete as expected

* improvements to inlining images in iTerm2 when shell running on top of `tmux`. It still doesn't work reliably but this is an issue with `tmux` rather than Murex

* `method` forwards exceptions rather than errors. This behaviour has been changed to surface issues as errors

* `profile_preload.mx` added to profile defaults. This will be loaded before any of the OS-specific profiles

* missing rune length check causing the shell to panic ([#617](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/617))

* fixed deadlock in flag parsing

* zero length string title bars should be ignored ([#614](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/614))

* minor improvements to documentation
